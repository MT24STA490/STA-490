#<center>The Purpose</center>
•	Discover the ratings of satisfaction for office workers with their superiors 
---
#<center>The Data</center>
•	Index
•	6 variables
o	Measuring 6 additional different variables that were suspected to have an influence over the ratings
•	The satisfaction rating
---
#<center>Table</center>
```{r cars, echo = FALSE}
x24 = read.table("https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/regression/x24.txt", skip = 45)

names(x24) = c("Index", "A1", "A2", "A3", "A4", "A5", "A6", "B")

```

```{r pressure}
knitr::kable(x24, format = 'html', align = "cccccccc", caption = "Office Worker's Ratings of their Superiors", vline = "|")
```
---
#<center>Equation</center>
•	B = A0 * X0 + A1 * X1 + A2 * X2 + A3 * X3 + A4 * X4 + A5 * X5 + A6 * X6
o	Multiple Linear regression
o	Variables 1 – 6
	X0, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6
o	Regression Coefficients
	A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6

#<center>The Output</center>
```{r}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, .1))
plot(x24, pch = 19, col = 'purple', las = 1)
abline(x24, lwd = 2)
```
---
#<center>Conclusion</center>
•The plot reinforces the linear relationship between the ratings of the 6 variables and the satisfaction ratings of the superiors
•This could be helpful for the superiors if they are trying to increase the satisfaction ratings
